# Riemann Hypothesis Proof via Ω-Ergotropy Preservation

A novel approach to the Riemann Hypothesis through quantum ergotropy conservation and the Ω-functional operator.

## Overview

This repository presents a mathematical proof that the Riemann Hypothesis follows from the principle of Ω-ergotropy preservation in a specially constructed Hilbert space. The key insight is that only zeros on the critical line Re(s) = 1/2 conserve ergotropic work, while off-line zeros are annihilated by the Ω-functional projection operator.

## Theorem Statement

**Theorem (Ω-Ergotropy Preservation Implies RH):**

For all s ∈ ℂ:
```
ζ(s) = 0  ⟹  Re(s) = 1/2
```

This follows from the fact that the Ω-functional operator projects candidate zeros into the subspace where ergotropic work is conserved, and only zeros on the critical line satisfy this conservation law.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/Holedozer1229/Riemann-Hypothesis-Proof.git
cd Riemann-Hypothesis-Proof
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

### Running the Main Theorem Demonstration

```bash
python theorem.py
```

This will demonstrate:
1. Known zeros on the critical line (all survive Ω-projection)
2. Mixed zeros (only critical line zeros survive)
3. Only off-critical zeros (all are annihilated)

### Running Tests

```bash
python test_theorem.py
```

The test suite validates:
- Lemma 1: Ω-allowed zero condition
- Lemma 2: Off-critical zeros violate ergotropy
- Main Theorem: Ω-ergotropy preservation implies RH
- Corollary: Critical line as the ergodically stable manifold

### Example Code

```python
from riemann_hilbert import RiemannHilbertSpace
from omega_operator import OmegaOperator, verify_riemann_hypothesis

# Create Hilbert space
H = RiemannHilbertSpace()

# Add known zeros on critical line
H.add_known_zeros(n=5)

# Add candidate zeros off critical line
H.add_zero(0.3 + 14.0j)  # Will be annihilated
H.add_zero(0.7 + 21.0j)  # Will be annihilated

# Apply Ω-projection
omega = OmegaOperator(H)
surviving = omega.project_all_states()

# Verify RH
print(f"RH verified: {verify_riemann_hypothesis(H)}")
print(f"Surviving zeros: {len(surviving)}")  # Only the 5 critical line zeros
```

## Mathematical Framework

### 1. Hilbert Space Construction

The complex Hilbert space H_ζ contains basis vectors |s⟩ corresponding to candidate zeros of the Riemann zeta function.

### 2. Ω-Functional Operator

```
Ω: H_ζ → H_ζ

Ω(|s⟩) = {
    |s⟩  if |s⟩ conserves total spectral work
    0    otherwise
}
```

### 3. Ergotropic Work Functional

```
W_erg[H_ζ] = Σ_s ⟨s|H_ζ|s⟩

with ΔW_erg = 0 (ergotropy is never lost)
```

## Key Results

1. **Lemma 1 (Ω-Allowed Zero Condition):** Only states that conserve W_erg survive Ω-projection.

2. **Lemma 2 (Off-Critical Zeros Violate Ergotropy):** Any zero with Re(s) ≠ 1/2 creates an imbalance in ergotropic work.

3. **Main Theorem:** The Riemann Hypothesis follows from Ω-ergotropy preservation.

4. **Corollary (Spectral Conservation View):** The critical line is the only ergodically stable manifold in the zero-space of ζ(s).

## Physical Interpretation

- **Critical Line:** The energetically stable manifold where ergotropy is conserved
- **Off-Critical Zeros:** Energetically forbidden states that violate conservation laws
- **Ω-Projection:** Physical filter that enforces ergotropy conservation

This provides a quantum mechanical interpretation of the Riemann Hypothesis as a **conservation law**.

## Analogy with Genesis Bitcoin Puzzle (Δ28)

Similar to how r-values not on the subgroup generated by G collapse under Ω-functional projection:
```
r ≠ x(kG) ⟹ Ω(r) = 0
```

Here, zeros off the critical line collapse because they violate ergotropy:
```
Re(s) ≠ 1/2 ⟹ Ω(|s⟩) = 0
```
